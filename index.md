Hello! My name is Matthew Pileggi. I am a graduate student at the University of Florida. Go Gators!

My journey with science began in the summer of 2016 at Valencia College in Orlando, Florida as an undergraduate student. My biology professor, Dr. Laurent invited me to participate in a DNA Barcoding research project. From that moment on, I knew that I was deeply in love with pipettes and [fasta files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format).

I am currently recent graduate of the University of Florida. My master's research involved characterizing the resistance patterns observed in (multi)drug-resistant bacteria isolated from livestock associated flies. One of my goals is to use next-generation sequencing technologies to identify resistance genes carried by these flies using cutting-edge bioinformatic tools for genomic analysis.
