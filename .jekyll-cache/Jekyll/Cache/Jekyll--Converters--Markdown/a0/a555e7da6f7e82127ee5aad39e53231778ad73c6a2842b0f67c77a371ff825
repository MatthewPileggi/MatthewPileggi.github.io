I"Ñ<p>Hello! My name is Matthew Pileggi. I am a graduate student at the University of Florida. Go Gators!</p>

<p>My journey with science began in the summer of 2016 at Valencia College in Orlando, Florida as an undergraduate student. My biology professor Dr. Laurent invited me to participate in a DNA Barcoding research project. From that moment on, I knew that I was deeply in love with pipettes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format">fasta files</a>.</p>

<p>Now I am part of the <a href="https://microbiota.wixsite.com/adam-wong">Wong Lab</a> characterizing the resistance patterns observed in (multi)drug-resistant bacteria isolated from livestock associated flies. One of my goals is to use next-generation sequencing technologies to identify resistance genes carried by these flies using cutting-edge bioinformatic tools for genomic analysis.</p>
